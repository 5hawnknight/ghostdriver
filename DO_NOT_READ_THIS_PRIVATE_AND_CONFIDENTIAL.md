# DO NOT READ THIS: PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

If you are reading this, means that my friend **Gui** was right:
**_people read what they shouldn't, but ignore what they should_**.

We are just a bunch of monkeys that learned how to read and write, aren't we.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE - I can't stress it enough - **PLEASE**, read thoroughly
the `README.md` that lives in this very directory.

It contains key informations to be able to use this project.
Most importantly, read it BEFORE you file an issue: most of the time you are
just doing something wrong (and there is nothing bad or shameful in that).

_Thanks_

Ivan

**P.S.** This is only _half_ ironic.
